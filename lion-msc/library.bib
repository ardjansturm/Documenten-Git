abstract = {Context: Gaps, cavities and rings in circumstellar disks are signposts of disk evolution and planet-disk interactions. We follow the recent suggestion that Herbig Ae/Be disks with a flared disk harbour a cavity, and investigate the disk around HD{\~{}}97048. Aims: We aim to resolve the 34{\$}\backslashpm{\$} 4 au central cavity predicted by Maaskant et al. (2013) and to investigate the structure of the disk. Methods: We image the disk around HD{\~{}}97048 using ALMA at 0.85{\~{}}mm and 2.94{\~{}}mm, and ATCA (multiple frequencies) observations. Our observations also include the 12CO J=1-0, 12CO J=3-2 and HCO+ J=4-3 emission lines. Results: A central cavity in the disk around HD{\~{}}97048 is resolved with a 40-46 au radius. Additional radial structure present in the surface brightness profile can be accounted for either by an opacity gap at {\~{}}90 au or by an extra emitting ring at {\~{}}150 au. The continuum emission tracing the dust in the disk is detected out to 355 au. The 12CO J=3-2 disk is detected 2.4 times farther out. The 12CO emission can be traced down to {\$}\backslashapprox{\$} 10 au scales. Non-Keplerian kinematics are detected inside the cavity via the HCO+ J=4-3 velocity map. The mm spectral index measured from ATCA observations suggests that grain growth has occurred in the HD{\~{}}97048 disk. Finally, we resolve a highly inclined disk out to 150 au around the nearby 0.5{\~{}}{\$}M{\_}{\{}\backslashodot{\}}{\$} binary ISO-ChaI 126. Conclusions: The data presented here reveal a cavity in the disk of HD 97048, and prominent radial structure in the surface brightness. The cavity size varies for different continuum frequencies and gas tracers. The gas inside the cavity follows non-Keplerian kinematics seen in HCO+ emission. The variable cavity size along with the kinematical signature suggests the presence of a substellar companion or massive planet inside the cavity.},

abstract = {The magnetic fields of young stars set their coronal properties and control their spin evolution via the star-disc interaction and outflows. Using 14 magnetic maps of 10 classical T Tauri stars (CTTSs) we investigate their closed X-ray emitting coronae, their open wind-bearing magnetic fields, and the geometry of magnetospheric accretion flows. The magnetic fields of all the CTTSs are multipolar. Stars with simpler (more dipolar) large-scale magnetic fields have stronger fields, are slower rotators, and have larger X-ray emitting coronae compared to stars with more complex large-scale magnetic fields. The field complexity controls the distribution of open and closed field regions across the stellar surface, and strongly influences the location and shapes of accretion hot spots. However, the higher order field components are of secondary importance in determining the total unsigned open magnetic flux, which depends mainly on the strength of the dipole component and the stellar surface area. Likewise, the dipole component alone provides an adequate approximation of the disc truncation radius. For some stars, the pressure of the hot coronal plasma dominates the stellar magnetic pressure and forces open the closed field inside the disc truncation radius. This is significant as accretion models generally assume that the magnetic field has a closed geometry out to the inner disc edge.},

abstract = {The photometric behaviour of a sample of 44 Herbig Ae/Be (HAeBe) candidate stars was studied using a uniform set of optical photometry obtained by the Hipparcos mission. Astro-physical parameters (distance, temperature, luminosity, mass, age) of this sample of stars were derived as well by combining the astrometric data provided by Hipparcos with data from lit-erature. Our main conclusions can be summarized as follows: (1) More than 65{\%} of all HAeBe stars show photometric vari-ations with an amplitude larger than 0. m 05; (2) HAeBes with a spectral type earlier than A0 only show moderate (amplitude {\textless} 0. m 5) variations, whereas those of later spectral type can (but not necessarily have to) show variations of more than 2. m 5. We explain this behaviour as being due to the fact that stars with lower masses become optically visible, and hence recognizable as Herbig Ae stars, while still contracting towards the zero-age main sequence (ZAMS), whereas their more massive counter-parts only become optically visible after having reached the ZAMS; (3) The Herbig stars with the smallest infrared excesses do not show large photometric variations. This can be under-stood by identifying the stars with lower infrared excesses with the more evolved objects in our sample; (4) No correlation be-tween the level of photometric variability and the stellar v sin i could be found. If the large photometric variations are due to variable amounts of extinction by dust clouds in the equatorial plane of the system, the evolutionary effects probably disturb the expected correlation between the two.},

@article{Claudi2008,
abstract = {SPHERE is an instrument designed and built by a consortium of French, German, Italian, Swiss and Dutch institutes in collaboration with ESO. The project is currently in its Phase B. The main goal of SPHERE is to gain at least one order of magnitude with respect to the present VLT AO facility (NACO) in the direct detection of faint objects very close to a bright star, especially giant extrasolar planets. Apart from a high Strehl ratio, the instrument will be designed to reduce the scattered light of the central bright star and subtract the residual speckle halo. Sophisticated post-AO capabilities are needed to provide maximum detectivity and possibly physical data on the putative planets. The Integral Field Spectrograph (IFS), one of the three scientific channels foreseen in the SPHERE design, is a very low resolution spectrograph (R{\~{}}20) which works in the near IR (0.95-1.35 µm), an ideal wavelength range for the ground based detection of planetary features. Its goal is to suppress speckle to a contrast of 10 7 , with a goal of 10 8 , and at the same time provide spectral information in a field of view of about 1.5 × 1.5 arcsecs 2 in proximity of the target star. In this paper we describe the overall IFS design concept. 1. INTRODUCTION SPHERE (Spectro-Polarimetric High-contrast Exoplanets REsearch:) is a second generation instrument for VLT optimized for high contrast imaging at the Nasmyth focus of one of the VLT units. The design of SPHERE is divided into four subsystems: the Common Path Optics and three science channels, a differential imaging camera (IRDIS), an Integral Field Spectrograph (IFS), and a visible imaging polarimeter (ZIMPOL). The Common Path includes pupil stabilizing fore optics (tip-tilt and derotator) where insertable polarimetric half-wave plates are also provided, the SAXO extreme adaptive optics system with a visible wavefront sensor, and NIR coronagraphic devices in order to feed IRDIS and IFS with a highly stable coronagraphic image in the NIR. ZIMPOL shares the visible channel with the wavefront sensor and includes its own coronagraphic system. While the ZIMPOL arm compares observations on two orthogonal polarization in order to detect the polarized light reflected by the planet on the stellar background, the former two channels (IRDIS and IFS) explore the stellar neighbourhood in order to find planetary spectral features. For the IFS, this quest is conducted searching for strong CH 4 absorption bands in both the stellar light reflected by gaseous Jupiter-like planets and in thermal emission from young-warm planets. Additional science topics which will be addressed by SPHERE include the study of brown dwarfs, circumstellar disks and related phenomena such as mass loss mechanisms, stellar winds, planetary nebulae and perhaps even supernova explosions.},

abstract = {Angular differential imaging is a high-contrast imaging technique that reduces quasi-static speckle noise and facilitates the detection of nearby companions. A sequence of images is acquired with an altitude/azimuth telescope while the instrument field derotator is switched off. This keeps the instrument and telescope optics aligned and allows the field of view to rotate with respect to the instrument. For each image, a reference PSF is constructed from other appropriately-selected images of the same sequence and subtracted to remove quasi-static PSF structure. All residual images are then rotated to align the field and are combined. Observed performances are reported for Gemini North data. It is shown that quasi-static PSF noise can be reduced by a factor $\backslash${\~{}}5 for each image subtraction. The combination of all residuals then provides an additional gain of the order of the square root of the total number of acquired images. A total speckle noise attenuation of 20-50 is obtained for one-hour long observing sequences compared to a single 30s exposure. A PSF noise attenuation of 100 was achieved for two-hour long sequences of images of Vega, reaching a 5-sigma contrast of 20 magnitudes for separations greater than 8". For a 30-minute long sequence, ADI achieves 30 times better signal-to-noise than a classical observation technique. The ADI technique can be used with currently available instruments to search for {\~{}}1MJup exoplanets with orbits of radii between 50 and 300 AU around nearby young stars. The possibility of combining the technique with other high-contrast imaging methods is briefly discussed.},

abstract = {Context. A new reduction of the astrometric data as produced by the Hipparcos mission has been published, claiming accuracies for nearly all stars brighter than magnitude Hp = 8 to be better, by up to a factor 4, than in the original catalogue. Aims. The new Hipparcos astrometric catalogue is checked for the quality of the data and the consistency of the formal errors as well as the possible presence of error correlations. The differences with the earlier publication are explained. Methods. The internal errors are followed through the reduction process, and the external errors are investigated on the basis of a comparison with radio observations of a small selection of stars, and the distribution of negative parallaxes. Error correlation levels are investigated and the reduction by more than a factor 10 as obtained in the new catalogue is explained. Results. The formal errors on the parallaxes for the new catalogue are confirmed. The presence of a small amount of additional noise, though unlikely, cannot be ruled out. Conclusions. The new reduction of the Hipparcos astrometric data provides an improvement by a factor 2.2 in the total weight compared to the catalogue published in 1997, and provides much improved data for a wide range of studies on stellar luminosities and local galactic kinematics.},

We focus our attention on four key Herbig Ae/Be stars to understand the structural properties responsible for the absence of silicate feature emission.{\textless}i{\textgreater}Methods. {\textless}i/{\textgreater}We investigate {\textless}i{\textgreater}Q{\textless}i/{\textgreater}- and {\textless}i{\textgreater}N{\textless}i/{\textgreater}-band images taken with Subaru/COMICS, Gemini South/T-ReCS, and VLT/VISIR.

From this, we characterize the radial density structure of dust and PAHs in the disk.{\textless}i{\textgreater}Results. {\textless}i/{\textgreater}The inner edge of the outer disk has a high surface brightness and a typical temperature between {\~{}}100–150 K and therefore, dominates the emission in the {\textless}i{\textgreater}Q{\textless}i/{\textgreater}-band.

We derive radii of the inner edge of the outer disk of 34{\textless}sub{\textgreater}-4{\textless}sub/{\textgreater}{\textless}sup{\textgreater}+4{\textless}sup/{\textgreater}, 23{\textless}sub{\textgreater}-5{\textless}sub/{\textgreater}{\textless}sup{\textgreater}+3{\textless}sup/{\textgreater}, 30{\textless}sub{\textgreater}-3{\textless}sub/{\textgreater}{\textless}sup{\textgreater}+5{\textless}sup/{\textgreater} and 63{\textless}sub{\textgreater}-4{\textless}sub/{\textgreater}{\textless}sup{\textgreater}+4{\textless}sup/{\textgreater} AU for HD 97048, HD 169142, HD 135344 B, and Oph IRS 48, respectively. For HD 97048 this is the first detection of a disk gap. The large gaps deplete the entire population of silicate particles with temperatures suitable for prominent mid-infrared feature emission, while small carbonaceous grains and PAHs can still show prominent emission at mid-infrared wavelengths. The continuum emission in the {\textless}i{\textgreater}N{\textless}i/{\textgreater}-band is not due to emission in the wings of PAHs. This continuum emission can be due to very small grains or to thermal emission from the inner disk. We find that PAH emission is not always dominated by PAHs on the surface of the outer disk.{\textless}i{\textgreater}Conclusions. {\textless}i/{\textgreater}The absence of silicate emission features is due to the presence of large gaps in the critical temperature regime. Many, if not all Herbig disks with spectral energy distribution classification “group I”, are disks with large gaps and can be characterized as (pre-) transitional. An evolutionary path from the observed group I to the observed group II sources seems no longer likely. Instead, both might derive from a common ancestor.},

abstract = {Using the Spitzer Space Telescope, we have observed 90 weak-line and classical T Tauri stars in the vicinity of the Ophiuchus, Lupus, Chamaeleon, and Taurus star-forming regions as part of the Cores to Disks (c2d) Spitzer Legacy project. In addition to the Spitzer data, we have obtained contemporaneous optical photometry to assist in constructing spectral energy distributions. These objects were specifically chosen as solar-type young stars with low levels of H emission, strong X-ray emission, and lithium absorption, i.e., weak-line T Tauri stars, most of which were undetected in the mid-to far-IR by the IRAS survey. Weak-line T Tauri stars are potentially extremely important objects in determining the timescale over which disk evolution may take place. Our objective is to de-termine whether these young stars are diskless or have remnant disks that are below the detection threshold of previous infrared missions. We find that only 5/83 weak-line T Tauri stars have detectable excess emission between 3.6 and 70 m, which would indicate the presence of dust from the inner few tenths of an AU out to the planet-forming regions a few tens of AU from the star. Of these sources, two have small excesses at 24 m consistent with optically thin disks; the others have optically thick disks already detected by previous IR surveys. All of the seven classical T Tauri stars show excess emission at 24 and 70 m although their properties vary at shorter wavelengths. Our initial results show that disks are rare among young stars selected for their weak H emission.},

abstract = {We studied the well known circumstellar disk around the Herbig Ae/Be star HD 97048 with high angular resolution to reveal undetected structures in the disk, which may be indicative of disk evolutionary processes such as planet formation. We used the IRDIS near-IR subsystem of the extreme adaptive optics imager SPHERE at the ESO/VLT to study the scattered light from the circumstellar disk via high resolution polarimetry and angular differential imaging. We imaged the disk in unprecedented detail and revealed four ring-like brightness enhancements and corresponding gaps in the scattered light from the disk surface with radii between 39 au and 341 au. We derived the inclination and position angle as well as the height of the scattering surface of the disk from our observational data. We found that the surface height profile can be described by a single power law up to a separation {\~{}}270 au. Using the surface height profile we measured the scattering phase function of the disk and found that it is well consistent with theoretical models of compact dust aggregates. We discuss the origin of the detected features and find that low mass ({\textless} 1 M{\_}Jup) nascent planets are a possible explanation.},

@article{DeBoer2016,
abstract = {We search for signs of ongoing planet-disk interaction and study the distribution of small grains at the surface of the transition disk around RXJ1615.3-3255 (RX J1615). We observed RXJ1615 with VLT/SPHERE. We image the disk for the first time in scattered light and detect two arcs, two rings, a gap and an inner disk with marginal evidence for an inner cavity. The shapes of the arcs suggest that they probably are segments of full rings. Ellipse fitting for the two rings and inner disk yield a disk inclination i = 47 $\backslash$pm 2 degrees and find semi-major axes of 1.50 $\backslash$pm 0.01" (278 au), 1.06 $\backslash$pm 0.01" (196 au) and 0.30 $\backslash$pm 0.01" (56 au), respectively. We determine the scattering surface height above the midplane, based on the projected ring center offsets. Nine point sources are detected between 2.1" and 8.0" separation and considered as companion candidates. With NACO data we recover four of the nine point sources, which we determine not to be co-moving, and therefore unbound to the system. We present the first detection of the transition disk of RXJ1615 in scattered light. The height of the rings indicate limited flaring of the disk surface, which enables partial self-shadowing in the disk. The outermost arc either traces the bottom of the disk or it is another ring with semi-major axis {\textgreater} 2.35" (435 au). We explore both scenarios, extrapolating the complete shape of the feature, which will allow to distinguish between the two in future observations. The most interesting scenario, where the arc traces the bottom of the outer ring, requires the disk truncated at r {\~{}} 360 au. The closest companion candidate, if indeed orbiting the disk at 540 au, would then be the most likely cause for such truncation. This companion candidate, as well as the remaining four, require follow up observations to determine if they are bound to the system.},
