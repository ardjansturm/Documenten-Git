\chapter{Introduction}
One of the biggest questions that arises in each human is how the world around us is formed. It intrigues children already that a pea grows to a complete plant and that their adults were once a child. Much research in astronomy is about how the universe has taken his shape as it is today. How stars, planets and galaxies are formed for example. It has been a question for a long time if the solar system was the only place in the universe to where planets exists. Since then, many indirect methods were developed that could tell if a star hosted planets and the first exoplanet was soon confirmed.
\bigskip

Scientists have made huge progress in the last few decades in understanding the formation of stars and planets. It is now common known that stars are formed by the collapse of a big cloud of gas and dust. The gas and dust that is left in the cloud after the birth of a star starts to fall towards it. This accretion material starts to orbit the star in a plane due to the conservation of angular momentum, forming an accretion disk. In this accretion disks planets start to form when grains stick together to form pebbles, pebbles planeto\"ids and planeto\"ids planets. Another possibility is that the disk gets gravitational unstable, the disk starts to fragment and gas giant planets are formed. %###cite Philip J. Armitage. Astrophysics of Planet Formation. Cambridge University Press, 2010.
\bigskip

The formation of these planets is actually much more complex since there are many processes going on in a disk. Direct imaging of planets and disks has been impossible for a long time, since the contrast between stars and planets is too big and the point spread function (PSF) of the star too much extended. With the development of special optics called coronographs that improve the contrast, special adaptive optics that correct for the distortion of the light in the atmosphere and special techniques to reduce the stellar PSF, we are now able to image planets and protoplanetary disks directly. This provides us detailed information of the conditions in different planetary systems and protoplanetary disk, which improves our understanding of the formation of planetary systems.
\bigskip

SPHERE, one of the instruments of the Very Large Telescopes (VLT) in Chili, was build for direct imaging of planets. This instrument collects high resolution data of exoplanets and circumstellar disk. One mode of the subsystems of the instrument gives light in parallel to IRDIS and IFS. IRDIS is the InfraRed Dual Imaging and Spectograph subsystem that provides classical imaging, dual band imaging, dual-polarization imaging and long slit spectroscopy with a good resolving power, IFS is the Integral Field spectrograph that provides a data cube of 39 monochromatic images \cite{Observatory2007}. Since IRDIS data is easier to reduce and to analyze, and the field of view (FOV) of IRDIS is much bigger than the FOV of the IFS, IRDIS data is much more often analyzed than IFS data. Since there exists as much IFS data as there exists IRDIS data, much of the disk data made by IFS is still unpublished.
\bigskip

Since the IFS can provide a resolved spectrum of an object, it is possible to get a spectrum of a protoplanetary disk. Untill now, we do not have detailed information about the colour of the object that mainly will be analyzed in this project, the disk around T-Tauri star RX J1615.3-3255 (RX J1615). Reliable spectral information of protoplanetary disks can lead us in the future to a better understanding of ongoing planet formation in protoplanatary disks in general, since resolved spectral data of a disk can tell us something about the grain properties in different regions of the disk. This could provide us a better feeling of the requirements for a planet to form in protoplanetary disks and the way planetary system as our solar system are formed. 
\bigskip

There are many steps to make for this to achieve. One of the first steps is a good reduction of the raw data. One of the main goals of this research is hence to investigate what the best way is to reduce the raw data: what calibration data is needed and which calibration steps there have to be taken. There are various effects at play that we want to understand if we have this basic reduction done. It appears that the disk gets better detected at longer wavelengths. One of the goals of the project is to check if this is a property of disks, or that this is only an effect of the adaptive optic performance getting better at longer wavelengths, which it generally does. By use of different post-processing techniques the starlight can be subtracted in order to detect the disk, but these techniques can effect the spectrum and the morphology of the disk. One goal of the project is hence to check how strong these effects are and what we can trust out of the data.

\chapter{Theory}
\section{Protoplanetary disks}
\begin{wrapfigure}{R}{0.35\textwidth}
\includegraphics[trim={4cm 11cm 11cm 4cm},clip,width = 0.35\textwidth]{classscheme}
\caption{The four classes of young stellar objects (YSO), from top to bottom: a cloud collapses into a protostar (Class 0), a disk starts to form by conservation of angular momentum (Class I), the outer envelope dissipated, the protostar is now only surrounded by a disk (Class II), the disk gets optically thin and a star with possibly a planetary system is left (Class III)}
\vspace{-60pt}
\label{fig:classscheme}
\end{wrapfigure}%

The formation of a star with a planetary system as the sun has multiple stages. The youngest stars are still embedded in the molecular clouds where they form from gravitational collapse of interstellar gas. Older disks are gravitationally stable and have been cleaned over time by planets. protoplanetary disks evolve by two meganisms: infalling gas and dust, known as viscous accretion which transports the angular momentum and photoevaporation. The evolution of protoplanetary disks is classified in four different classes, according to the scheme that Lada introduced in 1987, as illustrated in Figure \ref{fig:classscheme}. 
\bigskip

The youngest stars are found in Class 0. They have a massive accretion disk that is indistinct of the dense envelope. All the light of the protostar is absorbed by this accreting envelope, making these objects invisible in the optical. These objects were first no part of the classification because they were first discovered decades later when the first infrared and millimeter telescopes were built.
\bigskip

The objects in Class 1 have a distinct disk and get more visible in the optical, since the star in the center is less obscured by the decreasing density of the envelope. Since the density in the disk increases, the temperature rises and the peak of the emission of the disk starts shifting to the mid-IR. Objects in this class could also eject collimated jets with a high velocity from the poles. These jets are formed as a byproduct of the accretion process and could influence the evolutionary track of the object.
\bigskip

The envelope is totally disipated for Class 2 objects and the star is only surrounded by an optically thick accretion disk. These type of objects are also known as T-Tauri stars, named after the prototype T Tauri, if they have a mass smaller smaller than 2 $M_\odot$. These objects are all younger than 10 million years old. Analogs of these stars, but with a higher mass than 2 $M_\odot$ are called Herbig Ae/Be stars. 
\bigskip

The disk in Class 3 objects has dissipated, leaving the protostar with an optically thin debris disk and a possible planetary system. The SED no longer contains a disk component at longer wavelength, but is totally dominated by the light of the protostar. This class ends when the nuclear fusion in the core of the protostar starts and the protostar becomes a main sequence star.
\bigskip

Objects in the stage between Class 2 and Class 3 are called transition disks. These stars  have more than just a debris disk, but the disk starts to get less prominent. Some disks have a cleared region, close to the star. This part is heated the most by the star. This cleared region is often called a gap. Inside the cleared region an inner disk can be present as a remnant from the optically thick accretion disk.

\section{The object}
The main object of study is the disk around T-Tauri star RX J1615.3-3255 (hereafter RX J1615). RX J1615 is a star in the scorpius constellation on the southern hemisphere, with co\"ordinates 16 15 20.231 -32 55 05.10 and a member of the Lupus star forming region. The distance to this region is previously estimated to be 185 kpc \cite{Krautter1997}. The mass of RX J1615 is previously determined to be 1.1$M_\odot$ and the age 1.4 Myr\cite{Wahhaj2010}.

\caption{Reduction of IRDIS ADI data. From the outside in, companion candidate (cc1), arc (A1), two full rings (R1 and R2), another arc (A2), a gap (G), and an innermost disk structure (I1)\citep{DeBoer2016}}
\label{fig:irdisjos}
\end{wrapfigure}

\noindent
It is well known that this star hosts large circumstellar disk structures.  As illustrated in Figure \ref{fig:irdisjos}, there are two different rings detected in IRDIS data (R1 and R2) at $278\pm 2$au and $196\pm 2$au, an inner disk component (I1) at $56\pm 2$au and two arcs (A1 and A2). A2 is confirmed to be a full ring, but the detections have not been deep enough to determine the origin of A1, it could either be a seperate ring or the backward facing side of R1. \citep{DeBoer2016}
\bigskip

A reduction of IFS T-LOCI ADI data, taken in the Y-J range, is already available of the same dataset, Figure \ref{fig:ifsjos}. Template Locally Optimized Combination of Images (T-LOCI) is an advanced way of selecting regions to make a reference to subtract the point spread function of the star from the data, but conserving the signal of the disk in the data. In this data one ring (corresponding to R1 in Figure \ref{fig:irdisjos}) and small signal of the inner disk component (I1) and the arc closest to the star (A1) are detected.

\begin{figure}[ht]

\label{fig:ifsjos}
\end{figure}

RX J1615 is also resolved with the Submillimeter Array (SMA) at 880 $\mu m$ (Andrews) and with the  Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) 690 GHz continuum data (van der Marel). IRDIS and IFS detect scattered Near InfraRed (NIR) light of the disk, emitted by the star. These infrared observations, however, say something about the emission of the gas and dust of the disk itself, mainly coming from the core or mid-plane of the disk where the pressure of the gas and dust is relative high. Both observations show a cavity up to 20-30 au, confirming that RX J1615 has a transition disk.

\label{fig:SED}
\end{figure}

The spectral energy distribution (SED) of the star as determined by different research groups is illustrated in Figure \ref{fig:SED}. This figure displayes the contribution in flux of the object over the whole spectrum. The flux of the protostar is responsible for the contribution on the lower end of the SED. This contribution look like a blackbody spectrum with a temperature of about 1900K, peaking around the H-band \citep{Padgett}. The slowly decreasing part on the high end of the SED is due to signal of the disk. The disk is mostly radiating in the infrared, due to its much lower temperature.

\chapter{Methodology}
\section{IFS reduction for dummies}
Data taken with an integral field spectrograph contains for each pixel a spectrum, Figure \ref{fig:rawdata}. To reduce this to a cube with a frame for each wavelength bin, Figure \ref{fig:reduceddata}, several calibrations were needed. At first the dark current had to be subtracted and all pixels had to be corrected for their sensitivity using detector flat frames. After that the different spectra had to be located and the wavelength of all pixels calibrated. 

\begin{figure}[hb]

\end{subfigure}

\end{figure}

After correcting for the througput of the lenslet grid, the science reduction produced the final result with 39 spectral channels, each with a dimension of 291x291 spaxels.
\bigskip

The Common Pipeline Library (CPL)\citep{Observatory2007} is a library of commands that is able to do the basic reduction steps of SPHERE data. Running the CPL can be done by use of Esorex, which is a commandline driven package, or EsoReflex that provides an easy and flexible way to run the different recipes of the pipeline. Esorex requires the use of a set of frames (sof) file for each recipe. This can easily be automized using Python, but since it is much work to write a code that identifies the different calibration images and mistakes can easily be made in the selection of the required data, I have used EsoReflex for the reduction and I really recommend using EsoReflex in the future. EsoReflex provides a user interface in the form of a workflow with a setup of a basic reduction pipeline in advance, which can be adapted in an easy way. It identifies all the required data that is unsorted stored in the input directory and gives a warning if something is missing. 
\bigskip

The data needed for a basic reduction is listed in table \ref{Tab:data}. Note that all the data has to be taken in the same mode, YJ or YH, as the science frames. All calibration data needs a corresponding dark frame with the same exposure time. The detectorflats however are taken with many different exposure times. In order to deal with this, two detector flats are needed per calibration lamp with different exposure times. The flat with shortest exposure time acts in the reduction as a dark and bias frame for the other one. This is possible since the flats give relative values by which the pixels have to be divided to measure uniform light, so the values are typically close to one. 
\bigskip

All individual reductions of calibration data have an own recipe in the common pipeline. A good understanding of these recipes and the corresponding calibration files is useful to get clean results in the end.

\subsection{Master dark}
The master dark recipe median combined multiple raw dark frames into one master dark. This recipe determines from the master dark the position of pixels that give strange results in all measurements, which are called static bad pixels. It returns both a file that contains a master dark frame, consisting of the image, bad pixels, the rms and the weightmap and a file that contains a static bad pixel map, which has the same content as the second extension in the master dark frame. An example of a master dark is illustrated in figure \ref{fig:masterdark}. 
\bigskip

If a background calibration file is given to the final science reduction, the background calibration file is used to correct for the dark current. The difference between these two is small. The only difference is that a normal dark is taken in N\_NS\_OPAQUE infrared IRDIS coronagraph combination mode and a background calibration in N\_NS\_CLEAR, meaning that combination of coronographs used to take the data has changed\cite{Mouillet2013}.

\end{figure}
At this step, the variation in sensitivity of the different pixels on the detector was measured. This can be done by using the extreme useful ability of the IFS to obtain flats with the shutter of the instrument closed and one of its internal calibration sources turned on. This means that the detector can be illuminated directly, which enabled us to correct for the distortions of the detector itself. The distortions in the optical path are measured in the recipe that produces the instrument flat, described in the next paragraph. 
\bigskip

Since the IFS uses a range of wavelengths, different detector flats are needed to calibrate all pixels properly. The recipe returns the combined master flat frames for the different lamps that are used. The best flat to use in the rest of the recipes are the master detector flats Figure \ref{fig:masterdetectorflat}. Large scale flats are master flat frames that are smoothed with a gaussian. On this images the large scale structures in pixel to pixel variation in the signal response of the detector get visible, such as ghosts. Large scale flats and pre-amplifier flats can be used as a calibration file for the actual detector flat recipe, but if they are not provided, they are created from the raw data. One of the large scale flats is illustrated in figure \ref{fig:largescaleflat}

\subsection{Instrument flat}
\begin{figure}[!b]

\label{fig:instrumentflatrecipe}
\end{figure}
Instrument flats are obtained by taking a flat with three or four of the external calibration lamps on and is used to correct for the varying througput in the common path of the telescope and the instrument. After the dark subtraction, the flat field is divided by the detector flat. what has the effect of removing the detector response. This recipe returns both an instrument master flat which is the combined and reduced flat field before removing the detector response and the response of the integral field unit (IFU), which is the flat field after removing the detector response. The first can be used only for calibrating other calibration data, the latter can be used to reduce science data. The IFU flat field can be produced only if a reduced wavelength calibration is given. The production of the instrument flat is already possible with the positions of the spectrums only and is used to correct for the distortion of the lenslet grid in the wavelength calibration. The IFU flat does not give all pixels a sensitivity value, but assuming that most of the spatial distortion is due to the lenslet grid, the recipe returns the response of each individual lenslet. It gives for all pixels in the same spectrum a median value. This is why the IFU flat contains a typical stripe like feature. Both the IFU flat and the instrument flat are shown in figure \ref{fig:instrumentflatrecipe}. 

\subsection{Positioning spectra}
\begin{figure}[!b]

\end{figure}

The spectra positioning recipe determines the exact position of the different spectra on the detector with an accuracy of about 4 $\mu m$, which corresponds to 0.2 pixels on the detector \citep{Desidera}. This is enough to build a map with the location of the spectra, associating each pixel to an individual lenslet. It associates pixels with wavelengths according to a lenslet model. Note that this is a non-linear model, as is visible in \ref{fig:specpos}. Each pixel in this image has the value of the corresponding wavelength in micron. This model is just a good guess, the exact wavelength can be obtained by running the wavelength calibration. The seperation between the positioning of the spectra and the wavelength calibration makes the positioning of the spectra much better, which is the reason why they have split these steps in two different recipes. The raw calibration data for the spectra positioning recipe is obtained by illuminating the instrument with an external white calibration light source that is uniformly scattered by use of an integrating sphere that diffuses the incoming light, but preserves the power. A zoomed piece of the spectra positioning image is shown in figure \ref{fig:specpos}

\subsection{Wavelength calibration}
The wavelength calibration recipe refines the wavelength of the different pixels, by using data that is obtained by illuminating the instrument with three or four external lasers, emitting at 0.9877, 1.1237, 1.3094 and 1.5451($\mu m$). These lasers have been uniformly scattered with the same integrating sphere as mentioned in the section about the spectra positioning. The recipe tries to fit a spectrum on the positions that are determined in the spectra positioning recipe. Note that if a part of the spectrum does not fit on the detector, the recipe is unable to fit a spectrum, which is illustrated in figure \ref{fig:wavecal}.

\subsection{Science reduction}
In the science reduction recipe the science frames are finally calibrated. This recipe needs all the output of the different calibration recipes as input alongside the raw science frames in order to correct properly for all the aberations. This recipe uses all the reduced calibration data in order to correct the data for all the different noise sources and asign pixels of the detector to pixels of the result in the end: a 39 x 291 x 291 datacube.

\section{Post-processing methods}
After the basic science reduction, the disk around the star is still not visible to the naked eye. Post processing techniques, based on subtracting a model of the stellar PSF were needed to gain the best result in detection of the disk. Two different methods are used to make a model for the stellar PSF: angular differential imaging (ADI) and spectral differential imaging (SDI). But before constructing a model for the PSF, the data needs to be centered correctly.

\subsection{Centering}
The telescope is calibrated such that the star is about in the center of the image, but there is always a slight offset. Center frames can be used to determine the center of the images on a level up to tenths of a pixel. These center frames are science frames containing also four artificial satellite spots, created by the adaptive optics system with the center of the star exactly in the middle of the four satellite spots, Figure \ref{fig:centerframe}. These center frames are usually taken before, during and after the science run, such that for small changes of the position of the center in the dataset can be corrected.

\caption{results of the centering routine: four gaussians are fitted over the satellite spots in order to determine the exact position of the center of the frame.}
%\label{fig:masterdark}
\end{figure}

\bigskip
Center frames are reduced in the same way as normal science frames, using the same dark and flat frames. Then the image is first smoothed with a gaussian with a standard deviation of 25 that filters all the high frequency noise out and leaves a clean image of the four satellite spots. After that a single gaussian is fitted over each of the four satellite spots and a model is created for the combined satellite spots. The position of the center can be determined from the positions of the fitted gaussians. The fit of all the satellite spots on the centerframes were good, leaving almost no residual signal after subtracting the model from the data, as illustrated in Figure \ref{fig:resultmodel}. The positions of the satellite spots are accurately measured with an uncertainty between 0.40 and 0.45 pixels for both the x and y co\"ordinate for each spot. The uncertainty on the coordinates of the center is hence 0.2 pixels.

ADI is a post-processing method that constructs a model for the stellar PSF out of the rotation of the field during the night \cite{Marois2005}. Normally, telescopes correct for the rotation of the earth and hence the rotation of the object on the detector. To apply ADI on data, this correction is switched off, such that the field rotates over time during the night. The star can be considered as a point source that does not change under rotation. The disk however, is rotational assymetric. The total field rotation during the observation run was 69 degrees, in 16 different exposures, meaning that the signal has changed a lot on the detector over time. Taking the median per pixel, per wavelength over the whole time should hence give a model for the PSF of the star. Subtracting this model from each individual frame and realigning the data with each other by rotating each frame with the known parallactic angle, gave good results. 
\bigskip

Since the data was taken with more than an hour between the first and last exposure, the flux of the object on the detector changes. This is partially due to changes in the sky during the night, but more due to changes in the quality of the correction of the adaptive optics during the night. To correct for this the median amount of flux in an annulus that grows in size with wavelength is measured. This annulus has an inner radius that is in each frame located just outside the outer ring of flux that is created by the coronograph. Since the PSF scales with $ \propto\lambda/D$, the radii of the annulus has to change for different wavelengths, to measure the flux in the same region of the PSF. The measured flux over wavelength is illustrated in Figure \ref{fig:aonorm}. With this relative flux the PSF of the star in different exposures can be normalized such that it is correctly subtracted in each frame in the procedure. After the subtraction and before combination of the different frames, the normalization is reversed, such that the signal is not amplified in certain frames.


\subsection{Spectral differential imaging}

\end{wrapfigure}
Spectral differential imaging is a post-processing method that constructs a model for the PSF of the star by use of the wavelength dependency of the PSF. The PSF of a star scales with $ \propto\lambda/D$, which means that the resolution and hence the scale of the PSF is directly proportional to the wavelength. We expect therefore that the PSF of the star increases linearly with wavelength. The signal of the disk however does not. This means that this should leave us with a model for the PSF after taking a median over all 39 spectral channels that does not contain anything of the disk signal. After subtracting this model from the data we scaled everything back to the original dimensions, such that the signal of the disk lines up in each spectral channel. The different exposures have been combined by rotating them with the corresponding parallactic angle after which a median for each pixel in each spectral channel over the different exposures is taken. This provided an image with the highest signal-to-noise ratio.
\bigskip

In order to check if the scale of the PSF is directly proportional to the wavelength, we measured the distance between the different artificially created satellite spots in the center image, using the same model as in the procedure that centers the science frames. The result of this measurement and the expected slope are plotted in Figure \ref{fig:specklegrowth}. This result indicates that the size of the PSF is indeed directly proportional to the wavelength, which means that the througput of the instrument does not spatially distort different wavelengths and that the wavelength calibration and positioning of the spectra is done in the right way.

\end{wrapfigure}

\noindent
Just as in the angular differential imaging, the data needs to be normalized before we take the median in order to get a good model of the PSF in each spectral channel. Since the throughput of the atmosphere, the instrument and the common path of the telescope is wavelength dependent, we had to normalize the flux in the different spectral channels. Our first try was to average the amplitude of the four fitted gaussians over the satellite spots in the center frames, but this did not turn out that well. Secondly we tried to measure the flux in a fixed annulus around the center, after scaling the different spectral channels such that the PSFs lined up, Figure \ref{fig:throughputnorm}.
\bigskip

The normalization factor as derived in the second way mentioned differed just a little from the one using the center frames, but this left us with good results in the end. The dips in the normalization factors line up with the expected dips in the throughput of the atmosphere due to absorbtion, Figure \ref{fig:throughputnorm}, since there is a big abundance of strong absorbtion lines of water in that part of the spectrum. The general trend is a decreasing flux over wavelength. The SED of the star peaks in the H band, as discussed in section 2.2 and illustrated in Figure \ref{fig:SED} \citep{Padgett}. This would indicate that the total incoming flux of the star should slighty increase over the range of the IFS. The fact that we see a decrease in flux instead is definitely due to wavelength dependencies in the throughput of the instrument as illustrated in Figure \ref{fig:systemthrougput}.
